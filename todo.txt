---------- IDEAS ----------
Micro RTS - "Invasions"
    - Year increments from 1200 -> 1300
    - Goal is survive invasions and last the entire century.
    - Super pixelated (soldiers are literally single pixels or maybe 2-high).
    - Waves per decade / 10 years.
    - Ability to setup defenses at the beginning of each decade and then watch how it plays out.
    - Pauses between decades to allow you to reinforce defenses or make adjustments before letting next decade play out.
    - Use random seed for ranomization so that you can replay the same game over and over and try to beat it... then use a different seed for a different game to try to beat.
    - Castle in the middle that has health bar
        - Defeat if castle is destroyed
        - Randomize based on seed?
    - Map has different colors that affect movement + speed
        - Grass
        - Mud
        - Sand
        - Rocks
        - Water
        - Use proc gen for map
    - Types
        - Traits
            - Move speed
            - Combat range
            - Strength / power
            - Health
            - Special ability?
            - Cost
        - Clear color coding per unit type
        - Predictable behaviors based on traits
        - Soldier
        - Archer
        - Brute
        - Spy
    - Enemies
        - Same color coding, but with a different outline or something to denote enemy
        - Arrow of color coding showing where they are coming in from on the side of the screen
    - Things to do in between decades
        - Spend points on castle health
        - Spend points on buying more units
    - Get points based on
        - Time alive
        - Enemy units destroyed
    - Pathfinding
    - Need feeling of "soooo close!" or "I just barely beat it!" when finishing the game.
        - Should feel achievable but very close
        - Not too much strategy that it seems insurmountable / too difficult
